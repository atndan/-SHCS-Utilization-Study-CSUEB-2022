## CSUEB Student Health and Counseling Services (SHCS) 2022 Statistical Analysis.

The purpose of this paper is to strengthen the current study of Dr. Spencer about the utilization rate of our CSUEB health center and the impact of COVID by using time-series analysis and statistical test. 

Number of appointments in all outpatient clinics, including student health centers, have dropped across the country secondary to COVID. Even prior to COVID, studies show that the majority of students have an interest in health, but there is underwhelming use of Student Health Services across the country. An intervention from CSUEB staff has been implemented in attempts to increase the utilization rate of SHCS by reaching out to students via the student health portal reminding them of the medical services available on campus. This paper will go through exploratory data analysis and ANOVA test to analyze the effect of COVID and the effect of interventions upon the CSBEB Primary Care and Counseling Services.
